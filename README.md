# Cpp-Things

*C++ useful things*  
Random codes me and other contributors do, and may be used in other projects.  
This contains all types of c++ utilities not found on any common library, or that library is too big for a quick install 
  
The idea is simple:
- Quick import in your project, just download the .h/.hpp and include it.
- Easy to use with self-documented examples
- Reliability with tests

Feel free to contribute! See the [contributing](https://github.com/petacreepers23/Cpp-Things/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) section for more. :)
